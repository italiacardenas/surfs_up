# Surf's Up

## Overview of Surf's Up
This analysis was created to define the differences between tempertaures in Oahu, Hawaii between the monthbs of June and December. The main purpose of this analysis is to determine the temperature trends during this time before opening up a surf shop that also sells ice cream! The investor of the business would like to know whether the shop will have the opportunity to stay open year round or whether it will have to close down during some months of the year. 

Python 3.7.6 was used to run this analysis along with Anaconda 4.9.2, Jupyter Notebook, Flask and the dependencies, Numpy, Pandas, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy.


## Results 
- **Key Differences** :
  1. The mean temperature for both months are within the 70 degrees range, however June is a slightly warmer month with an rounded up 75 degrees compared to the rounded 71 degrees during December.
  2. Although the mean temperature for these months are within range, the month of December can get as low as 56 degrees while June does not go below 64 degrees.
  3. Max temperatures are also within ranges of each other, but June's max temperature is 85 degrees, that's 2 degrees higher than December's at 83 degrees.
  4. Although  December's max temperature reaches 80 degrees, according to the histgrams below, the frequency of an 80 degree December day is less likely than a June day reaching 80 degrees. 
  5. With that said, both of these months frequently have tempertures in the 70s.
